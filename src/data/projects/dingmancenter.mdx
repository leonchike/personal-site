### My Role: I wear multiple hats at the Dingman Center, each serving the same core mission – turning entrepreneurial dreams into reality.

- **Mentor & Advisor:** Guiding the next generation of innovators, I assist in refining their nascent ideas into viable ventures. Whether it's carving out robust business models, crafting persuasive pitch decks, or identifying potential market gaps – I'm there every step of the way.
- **Team Building:** A startup's success often hinges on its team. Leveraging my industry insights and network, I aid startups in scouting and onboarding the right talent that aligns with their vision and values.
- **Judge:** Each year, the Dingman Center comes alive with the energy of pitch competitions. And when time permits, I take on the role of a judge, assessing and celebrating the innovative solutions these bright minds bring to the table.
