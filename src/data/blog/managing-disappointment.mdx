Leadership is a delicate balance between nurturing your team's aspirations and navigating the often harsh realities of the workplace. One of the most challenging aspects of this role is managing disappointment—both your team's and your own. As the saying goes, "leadership is disappointing people at a rate they can absorb."

## The Disappointment Frontier

The "disappointment frontier" is a concept that encapsulates the disparity between your team's expectations and the reality they encounter in the workplace. It represents the potential for disappointment that arises when these two elements are misaligned. The larger the gap between expectations and reality, the more significant the disappointment can be when they inevitably collide.

As a leader, it is essential to be aware of and proactively manage the disappointment frontier. This involves recognizing and addressing the various factors that can contribute to its growth. One common pitfall is the temptation to shield your team from harsh realities in an attempt to protect them from worry or difficult conversations. While this may be well-intentioned, it can actually exacerbate the problem by creating a false sense of security and leaving team members unprepared for the challenges they may face.

Another factor that can contribute to the expansion of the disappointment frontier is the projection of an illusion of control over situations that are, in reality, beyond your influence. This may be done in an effort to gain trust from your team or even to convince yourself of a greater level of certainty than actually exists. However, when this illusion is shattered by the inevitable intrusion of reality, it can lead to a profound sense of disappointment and a loss of trust in your leadership.

Fostering a team culture that is misaligned with the broader company culture can also contribute to the growth of the disappointment frontier. When your team operates in a bubble, with norms and expectations that are out of sync with the rest of the organization, it creates a disconnect that can breed disappointment. Team members may feel blindsided when they encounter the realities of the wider company culture, leading to frustration and disillusionment.

Overpromising and underdelivering is another common pitfall that can rapidly expand the disappointment frontier. When leaders make grandiose promises about things like promotions, pay raises, or exciting projects without a realistic plan for delivering on them, they set their team up for disappointment. The initial excitement and motivation generated by these promises can quickly sour when reality fails to meet the inflated expectations.

Failing to proactively address these issues allows the disappointment frontier to grow unchecked. Like a balloon being continually inflated, the pressure builds, and the potential for a significant letdown increases. When reality finally intervenes, as it inevitably will, the disappointment can be far more acute and damaging than if expectations had been managed from the outset.

The key to effectively managing the disappointment frontier lies in proactively recognizing and addressing these contributing factors. By being transparent about the realities your team faces, maintaining a grounded perspective on what you can and cannot control, aligning your team culture with the broader organization, and setting realistic expectations, you can help to keep the disappointment frontier in check. This proactive approach allows you to navigate the challenges and setbacks that are an inherent part of the workplace with greater resilience and adaptability.

## Strategies for Managing the Disappointment Frontier

To effectively manage the disappointment frontier, leaders must focus on increasing context and managing expectations. By doing so, you can bring reality closer to your team and minimize the potential for disappointment.

### 1. Radical Transparency

One of the most powerful tools in a leader's arsenal is transparency. Share as much context as possible about developments in other teams, the company, and with customers. This empowers your team to make informed decisions and reduces the likelihood of surprises. Be clear about what you can and cannot control, and what you can and cannot promise.

For example, if promotions are decided by a committee and not solely by you, make that clear to your team. You can promise to advocate for them and give them the best chance possible, but you can't guarantee a promotion. This transparency helps team members prepare for the possibility of not getting promoted, reducing the disappointment if it doesn't happen.

### 2. Own Your Decisions and Be a Collaborator

When you have control over a decision, own it, even if it may be unpopular. Your team will appreciate your honesty and the opportunity to discuss the matter directly with you. This reduces disappointment more quickly than hiding behind statements like "the company has decided..."

For situations beyond your control, be a collaborator. Work with your team to navigate these challenges together, fostering partnership rather than creating barriers. If a team member is up for a promotion decided by a committee, collaborate with them to put together the strongest promotion packet possible and vouch for them in the committee meeting. If they don't get the promotion, continue this collaboration to help them understand why and what they can do to increase their chances next time. This positions you as a partner rather than a barrier, directing disappointment at the situation rather than at you.

### 3. Conduct Regular Reality Checks

Regularly assess the size of your team's disappointment frontier and identify areas where you may be inadvertently contributing to its growth. Ask yourself:

- What are the biggest recurring sources of disappointment for my team?
- How big is their disappointment frontier right now? What might I be shielding them from or overpromising on?
- How can I shrink the frontier? What can I do to manage expectations and bring reality closer to my team?
- What can I do to be more of a collaborator on the things I can't control?
- Am I ever hiding my role as the decision-maker because I don't want to be the bad guy? How can I be more transparent about this?

Also, consider the frontier between you and your own manager. How can you discuss it with them to ensure you're operating with a realistic understanding?

## Navigating Zero-Sum Situations

<InlineReadNext category="Leadership" postSlug="managing-disappointment" />
In any organization, there will be zero-sum situations stemming from limited resources,
strategic decisions, customer needs, or market conditions. As a leader, you will
often find yourself unable to give your team everything they want, such as:

- Promotions, when there isn't a need for the role they want to move into
- Pay raises, when the company can't afford it or it would create significant pay disparities
- Exciting new projects, when the focus must be on less glamorous but necessary work
- Continued work on current projects, when priorities change and resources must be reallocated

Working through these situations involves identifying, mitigating, and managing disappointment. It's a core leadership skill that is often overlooked in manager training, despite being far more common than the more positive aspects of leadership.

## Closing Thoughts

Managing disappointment is about increasing context and managing expectations to bring reality closer to your team. Overcommunication, transparency, and a clear delineation between what you can and can't control are key to navigating the disappointment frontier.

Remember, your role as a leader is not to create a perfect, disappointment-free environment. It's to help your team successfully navigate reality with you as their guide. Even CEOs must manage their own disappointment frontier with their board and investors.

By embracing radical transparency, owning your decisions, collaborating on what you can't control, and continuously conducting reality checks, you can successfully manage the disappointment frontier and foster a culture of resilience within your team. It's a delicate art, but one that is crucial to effective leadership.
