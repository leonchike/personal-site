In the face of natural disasters, individuals often find themselves grappling with the loss of essential items and the need to quickly replace them. As a product manager, my goal was to design and develop an onboarding experience that not only streamlines the process of placing orders for lost items but also drives comprehension and improves engagement rates for new users.

In this post, we will delve into the key aspects of our AI-powered onboarding solution, discussing the technologies employed, the design considerations, and the impact it has had on our users and business objectives.

<br />

## The Challenge of Onboarding in Disaster Recovery

When individuals are affected by natural disasters, they are often overwhelmed with the task of replacing lost items while dealing with the emotional and logistical challenges of the situation. Traditional onboarding processes, which typically involve manual data entry and extensive form-filling, can be time-consuming and frustrating for users in these circumstances.

Our objective was to streamline the onboarding process, making it as efficient and user-friendly as possible. We aimed to reduce the cognitive load on users by automating the extraction of relevant information from their uploaded documents and pre-generating their carts and profiles.

<br />

## Harnessing the Power of AI for Document Processing

To achieve our goal of a seamless onboarding experience, we leveraged the power of AI, specifically focusing on natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision techniques.

### Custom-Trained Model for Data Extraction

We built a custom-trained model using OpenAI's platform to extract relevant information from the documents uploaded by users, such as receipts and insurance documents. This model employs a combination of NLP and computer vision algorithms to process the textual and visual content of the documents.

The NLP component of the model analyzes the text within the documents, identifying key details such as item descriptions, quantities, and prices. It utilizes techniques like named entity recognition and sentiment analysis to understand the context and extract meaningful information.

```python
import openai

def extract_data(document):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=f"Extract relevant data from the following document:\n\n{document}",
        max_tokens=100,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
    )

    extracted_data = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return extracted_data
```

Meanwhile, the computer vision algorithms process the uploaded images, recognizing and categorizing the items present. These algorithms employ techniques like object detection and image classification to identify specific items and their attributes.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def detect_objects(image):
    # Load pre-trained object detection model
    net = cv2.dnn.readNetFromCaffe("deploy.prototxt", "model.caffemodel")

    # Perform object detection
    blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(image, 1.0, (300, 300), (104.0, 177.0, 123.0))
    net.setInput(blob)
    detections = net.forward()

    # Process detections and extract object information
    objects = []
    for i in range(detections.shape[2]):
        confidence = detections[0, 0, i, 2]
        if confidence > 0.5:
            class_id = int(detections[0, 0, i, 1])
            # Extract object details and append to objects list
            # ...

    return objects
```

By combining the power of NLP and computer vision, our custom-trained model can accurately extract the necessary information from the uploaded documents, laying the foundation for a seamless onboarding experience.

### Generating Accurate and Context-Aware Content with LLMs

Once the relevant information is extracted from the documents, we employ large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate and context-aware product descriptions and user profiles.

LLMs, such as GPT-3, have the ability to understand the context and semantics of the extracted information. By fine-tuning these models on our specific domain and providing them with the extracted data, we can generate highly personalized and relevant content for each user.

```python
import openai

def generate_product_description(product_data):
    prompt = f"Generate a product description based on the following data:\n\n{product_data}"

    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=100,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
    )

    product_description = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return product_description
```

By leveraging the power of LLMs, we can automatically generate detailed and accurate product descriptions, saving users the time and effort of manually entering this information. Similarly, LLMs can assist in creating personalized user profiles based on the extracted data, further enhancing the onboarding experience.

### Step 1: Document Upload

The onboarding process begins with users uploading any relevant documents related to their claim, such as receipts or insurance documents. We designed an intuitive and user-friendly interface that guides users through the document upload process.

By providing clear instructions and visual cues, we ensure that users can easily navigate the upload process and provide the necessary documents for processing.

### Step 2: Cart Generation

Once the documents are uploaded, our custom-trained model extracts the relevant data and generates a cart based on the identified items and quantities. This automated cart generation saves users the time and effort of manually adding each item to their cart.

The generated cart is presented to the user in a clear and organized manner, allowing them to review the items and make any necessary adjustments.

### Step 3: User Review and Finalization

In the final step of the onboarding process, users review their generated cart and have the opportunity to make any changes before finalizing their order. We designed this step to provide users with full control and transparency over their order.

By allowing users to review and modify their cart, we ensure that they have confidence in their order and can proceed with peace of mind.
