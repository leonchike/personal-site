### Challenging Traditional Finance Narratives:

At Capital One Innovation Labs, our mission was to reimagine and enrich the banking experience. We set out to develop novel strategies that diverged from the typical banking framework, aiming to transform how financial services are perceived and delivered.

### Tailored Financial Advisory Through In-depth Psychological Insight:

Leveraging research from the University of Maryland's Psychology Department, my team and I developed a risk-tolerance simulation tool for Capital One's financial advisory services. This tool was more than just a static application; it engaged clients in real-time investment scenarios to assess their risk appetite through a sophisticated mix of risk and reward factors.

### Highlights:

- **Algorithmic Innovation**: I led the design and implementation of a cutting-edge risk-tolerance algorithm, utilizing advanced data analytics and statistical modeling. This tool equipped Capital One's financial advisors with a powerful resource to create personalized investment strategies for each client.
- **Revolutionizing Digital Banking**: We integrated the risk-tolerance simulation into Capital One's digital banking platform, enhancing the advisor-client relationship. This integration led to significant achievements: a 65% increase in monthly client interactions, improved client retention, and a high Net Promoter Score, all testifying to the enhanced customer satisfaction and engagement.

Ultimately, my tenure at Capital One was more than just about reshaping financial advisory services. It was an exploration into the core of human financial aspirations, aiming to develop tools that not only align with but also respect and amplify these aspirations. This experience was a journey in redefining what banking could be in the modern era.
