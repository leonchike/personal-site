As the culmination of my intensive MBA program at Georgetown University, I ventured into an ambitious consultancy project with Camst Group, a leading name in Italy's culinary sector, specializing in catering and meal distribution.

### The Challenge:

Camst aspired to revolutionize the meal vending experience through a network of technologically superior machines offering fresh, ready-to-pick meals. My task involved creating a seamless digital ordering system and an efficient supply chain to ensure timely delivery to each vending machine.

### Key Responsibilities:

#### Digital Experience Design

I developed an intuitive app interface that simplified customer ordering while streamlining backend processes, aligning user needs with operational efficiency.

#### Vendor & Meal Selection

My role extended to conducting detailed analyses of potential tech vendors and designing a diverse menu tailored to suit the innovative distribution model.

#### Supply Chain Framework

Drawing on Camst's extensive logistics expertise, I crafted a supply chain strategy that guaranteed punctual and precise meal distribution.

### Outcome:

Our strategic proposal laid the groundwork for a â‚¬25M smart vending initiative, encompassing:

- Defined Key Performance Indicators for measuring success.
- A comprehensive risk assessment to anticipate and mitigate challenges.
