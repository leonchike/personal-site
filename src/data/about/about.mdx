Hey there! I'm Chike - a product manager, coder, and aspiring leader on a mission to make the web a more productive yet inspiring place for all.

<br />

Throughout my career at organizations like Deloitte Consulting, Deloitte Digital, and currently the startup Rebuildee, I've been fortunate to collaborate with brilliant minds from all walks of life. Their diverse perspectives and the lessons they've imparted are what I cherish most. An MBA from Georgetown University and a finance background from the University of Maryland round out my arsenal.

<br />

When I'm not exploring the latest web trends, you can find me exploring nature with my wife and pup, or spending time with friends. I'm a firm believer that feeding your creative spirit through meaningful relationships is just as important as feeding your ambition.
