Visiting the pacific northwest is always wonderful, but it is even more special to visiting Portland. I stumbled across what I thought to be a small bookstore, but it was much more than that. It was a city of books. I spent two days of my trip exploring the seven floors stacked with books.

<br />
The staff was unbelievably helpful and friendly. They helped me find a few books
I had been looking for and a few I didn't know I needed.

<br />
Arrive with curiosity and leave with answers.. and maybe a book or two... 20+ in
my case.

I've always loved aviation, and the level of progress we are a species have made in the last century is incredible. I visited the Boeing Everett Factory to see some of the last 747s, the new 787 and 777x, on the factory line.

<br />
It was a surreal experience to see the scale of the factory (currently the largest
building in the world by volume that generates its own micro-climate inside) and
the amount of work and technology involved in building aircrafts used by millions
of people every day.
<br />
<br />
Boeing regularly hosts tours of the factory, if you are in the Seattle area and
have a free morning or afternoon, I highly recommend making the trip to Everett.

  Unfortunately, I could not take pictures inside the factory but I did at the
  aviation museum.
