Navigating the complex world of financial regulations, I had the unique opportunity to intern with GE's esteemed financial planning team, focused on the US-Canada region.

<br />

### Precision Auditing:

My hands-on exposure involved methodically testing and reporting on critical internal policy audits, ensuring stringent compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act â€“ a testament to GE's commitment to financial transparency and accountability.

<br />

### Strategic Enhancements:

Our team's analysis was more comprehensive than just identifying discrepancies. We proactively pinpointed areas for process and policy improvement. Our drive led to the following:

1. **Standardization**: Introducing consistent audit practices across different functions.
2. **Simplification**: Removing redundant steps, enhancing process efficiency.
3. **Comparability**: Ensuring the devised policies can be benchmarked internally and against industry standards.
