Over the years, I have built a collection of books that have provided me with great inspiration and knowledge. They range from the very technical about a specific subject area to the more general and even philosophical.

Below are a few of my favorites and my thoughts about why I found them meaningful.

      Most things we as humans interact with have been created by members of our own species. This is particularly apparent if you live in an urban area. Apart from the trees and reminders of nature, most of the things we interact with are designed by humans.
      This book is a classic, and for a good reason. It is a great read and provides much insight into how we interact with the world around us and the lengths designers and engineers go through to make sure we don't notice the design.

      This book is a must-read for anyone interested in software development. It is a collection of essays that cover a wide range of topics, from the importance of testing to the significance of communication.
      It is a great read, and I have returned to it many times over the years.

      I don't have a favorite book, but this one is definitely up there. <br /><br />
      It is one of the most unique perspectives on modern life I have ever read. Rory is a seasoned advertising executive with a unique way of viewing the world. In this witty book, he shares unexpectedly wonderful insights from his career and life.
