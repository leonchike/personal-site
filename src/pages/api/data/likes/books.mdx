As the years have rolled on, my library has grown with a diverse mix of books – from deeply technical guides to expansive philosophical ponderings. Each book has been a source of inspiration, a fountain of knowledge, or sometimes, a gentle companion during moments of introspection.

Let me share a handful of these treasures and their impressions on me.

  <div>
    <p>
      Iris Chang’s "The Rape of Nanking" is a harrowing testament to one of the darkest moments in the annals of human history.

      Chang's meticulous research and evocative prose paint a vivid picture, shedding light on a chapter of history that has been, for many years, overshadowed or denied. It is a brave, unflinching account that challenges us to confront the depths of human depravity and the importance of remembering and acknowledging the past.
