After adopting my puppy, Zoey, I quickly realized how much exercise she loved to receive. I lived in an apartment in the city, so short walks were not enough. My wife and I soon picked up on taking weekly hikes, and both fell in love with it.

Over time we explored new tails, climbed higher peaks, and traversed farther distances. With each journey, we found ourselves more connected to nature and each other; however, most importantly, we loved seeing Zoey freely explore. The time spent has allowed us to disconnect, reflect on our lives, and gain new perspectives.

Since discovering our love for hiking, we have enjoyed taking breathtaking walks through mountains and streams around the US and worldwide. I want to share a few of those hiking locations for both my personal reflection and to share with others.
