  After adopting my puppy, Zoey, I quickly realized how much exercise she loved
  to receive. I lived in an apartment in the city, so short walks were not
  enough. My wife and I soon picked up on taking weekly hikes, and both fell in
  love with it.

  Over time we explored new tails, climbed higher peaks, and traversed farther
  distances. With each journey, we found ourselves more connected to nature and
  each other; however, most importantly, we loved seeing Zoey freely explore.
  The time spent has allowed us to disconnect, reflect on our lives, and gain
  new perspectives.

  Since discovering our love for hiking, we have enjoyed taking breathtaking
  walks through mountains and streams around the US and worldwide. I want to
  share a few of those hiking locations for both my personal reflection and to
  share with others.

## A few of my favorite hikes

<br />

### Big Basin Redwoods State Park - San Francisco, CA

This is a more involved 24 mile hike that takes you through the redwoods and along the coast. It is a great hike for those who want to experience the redwoods and the ocean in one day. The hike begins in the hills of the Big Basin and ends by big creek forest at the Pacific Ocean. The hike is a bit more challenging, but the views are worth it.
