Visiting the pacific northwest is always wonderful, but it is even more special to visiting Portland. I stumbled across what I thought to be a small bookstore, but it was much more than that. It was a city of books. I spent two days of my trip exploring the seven floors stacked with books.

<br />
The staff was unbelievably helpful and friendly. They helped me find a few books
I had been looking for and a few I didn't know I needed.

<br />
Arrive with curiosity and leave with answers.. and maybe a book or two... 20+ in
my case.
