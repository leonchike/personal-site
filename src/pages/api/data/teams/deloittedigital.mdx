**Company:** Deloitte Digital is now a subsidiary of Deloitte, focusing on providing design and technology expertise for Deloitte's clients.

I worked with the Deloitte Digital team with a focus on reviewing aging client applications to design an architecture focused on modern software design. I worked with a team that helped modernize a large US-based airline's application suite and worked with an internal team to improve Deloitte's technology used to manage and track the performance of its thousands of professionals.
