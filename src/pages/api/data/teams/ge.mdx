As an intern at GE, I worked with the financial planning team to test and report on internal policy audits in the US-Canada region for Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and internal purchasing systems.

We identified audit policy and process improvements to ensure future sustainability through standardization, simplification, and comparability.
