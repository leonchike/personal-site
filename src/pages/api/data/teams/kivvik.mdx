**Company:** Slack for financial advisors

Kivvik is a client engagement platform for service professionals. Our product gives financial advisors more insight into clients' lives by allowing streamlined conversations and automated outreach for significant life events.

At Kivvik, I led the product development team and shipped the client engagement platforms. As a co-founder, my responsibilities and reach touched each aspect of the company and our services. I am incredibly proud of the levels of customer engagement and my team's emphasis on continuously striving to create better experiences through direct customer feedback. I will forever appreciate the lessons I learned at Kivvik and apply them to my work and personal life.
