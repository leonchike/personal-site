**Abstract:** Wangari Mathenge is a Nairobi-born, Chicago-based artist. Her work has been featured and lives in galleries and museums worldwide.

I joined Wangari Mathenge's team to design and engineer a web gallery to help her reach a broader audience and showcase past and upcoming works. I shipped a full-suite content management system, an analytics dashboard, and an immersive online gallery.
