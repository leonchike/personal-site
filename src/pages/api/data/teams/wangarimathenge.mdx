**Abstract** Wangari Mathenge is a Nairobi born, Chicago based artist. Her work has been featured and lives in galleries and museums across the world.

I join Wangari Mathenges team to design and engineer a web gallery to help her reach a broader audience and showcase past and upcoming works. I shipped a full suite content management system, an analytics platform and immersive online gallery.
