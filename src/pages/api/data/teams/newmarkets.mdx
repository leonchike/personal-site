Worked as a venture fellow under Mark Grovic (co-founder, general partner). I gained a deep understanding of venture capital and private equity. During my time at New Markets, I reviewed over $90 million in deal flow; focusing on the performance of portfolio companies, setting KPIs unique for each business, and reviewing prospective companies for investment. When examining prospects, my team focused on the company's financial performance, projections, the quality founding team, and gaps in key roles necessary for future growth.
