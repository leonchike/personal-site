**Company:** A place for those planning a wedding to source vendors by placing requests for services. Vendors review requests and place bids for work that aligns with their skills, interest, and availability.

Bellavent began as an MBA project. The idea grew over time, leading my partners, Bek Akhmedov and Kenny Gabel, to found the company. During the lifespan of the venture, we designed and built an application using Bubble.io and fundraised to grow the venture. We formed partnerships with national tradeshows and built a network of vendors as part of our strategy to grow the company.

Led the development of a dual-sided marketplace that connected customers with vendors. Drove $300K in listings within the first month of launch. Focusing on the technology, I owned the design and user experience of the application and shipped a full-featured application.
