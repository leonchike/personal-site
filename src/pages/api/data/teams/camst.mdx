During my last year in my MBA program at Georgetown University, I had the unique opportunity to work with the largest catering and meal distribution company in Italy, Camst.

Camst was interested in building a network of advanced meal vending machines. These devices will help customers reserve and pick up fresh, ready meals. I joined the team to design an application to aid in the ordering process and the supply chain logistics required to ensure meals are prepared and delivered to the correct locations timely. This project involved an analysis of potential vendors, creating a menu of meals suitable for this distribution network, and utilizing Camst's delivery expertise to build upon its network.

Our final deliverable was centered around providing strategic recommendations for a â‚¬25M smart vending venture, outlining KPIs, risks, opportunities, capital requirements, and partnerships to facilitate market entry into Germany, France, and Spain.
