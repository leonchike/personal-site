A close friend, Emmanuel Kaska, and I founded Agile Division, a design agency for branding and web development. We worked to build products for Northrup Grumman, Capital One, and My Money Conference, among other clients.

Our approach focused on automating the system architecture for each project and employing a tight-feedback loop with our clients to iterate towards the final project deliverable.
