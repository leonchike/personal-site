**Abstract:** CapitalOne acquired local cafes to offer their services in a more relaxed setting.

I worked with Capital One Innovation Labs to create services to enhance the general banking experience. Our goal was to experiment with avenues that differed from the traditional banking atmosphere.

I led a team to create a risk-tolerance simulation for their financial advisory segment. This risk-tolerance assessment used research developed through the University of Maryland's Psychology Department. It aimed to place the individual in an investment scenario and carefully present risks and rewards to measure and evaluate their intrinsic risk tolerance. This data was used by Capital One's financial advisors to extract insight and better tailor portfolios.
