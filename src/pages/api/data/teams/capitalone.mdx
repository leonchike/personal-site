**Abstract:** CapitalOne acquired local cafes to offer their services in a more relaxed setting.

I worked with Capital One Innovation labs to create services to enhance and relax the banking experience. The goal was to remove the banking atmosphere and pressure experienced during the banking process.
I led a team to create a risk-tolerance simulation for their financial advisory divisions. This risk-tolerance assessment used research developed through the University of Maryland's Psychology Department. It aimed to place the individual in an investment scenario and carefully present risks and rewards to measure and evaluate their intrinsic risk tolerance. This data is used by Capital One's financial advisors to extract insight and better tailor portfolios.
