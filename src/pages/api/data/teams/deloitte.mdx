<!-- I led various teams at Deloitte, each specializing in different parts of its emerging technology business.

**Software development** - Led a data analytics team at Deloitte to build client-facing software that analyzed data from various sources to provide insights into the performance of each client project. The software was built using multiple technologies, including Javascript, Python, SQL, and Tableau. My team was responsible for the software's design, development, and testing. The software is used by clients to improve their management decision-making and was used by Deloitte to strengthen its internal processes.

**Project management** - I managed a team of 30 professionals to exceed project delivery objectives. I designed Python and Microsoft Azure database-driven record-keeping and record management tools to report project data to team leads to keep Deloitte's internal and client-facing projects on track. My efforts focused on helping Deloitte this reporting to build financial forecasts and analyze the project burn rate.

**Process Robotics Automation (RPA)** - Developed RPA tool that compiled and analyzed data for the financial valuation of pension plans. The tool significantly reduced process cycle time by 45% and increased accuracy—I used the tool to lead the team through the valuation of pension plans with over 265,000 participants.

**Contracts** - I led a team to develop proposals to expand Deloitte's business. Won a $20 million contract to provide consulting services to a large financial institution. -->
