<!-- **Company:** Rebuildee is a crowdfunding platform designed to help those affected by natural disasters recover through the aid of private and non-profit donors.

I joined Rebuildee as a product designer in December 2021 to design the initial version of the app to aid the founders in fundraising. After the initial seed raise, I joined the company as the head of engineering. I led a team of engineers to scale the business' platforms. I worked with the company's CTO to ship personalized features, build product roadmaps, and manage the engineering team in the capacity of a project manager.

I set a strategy for future growth and designed a framework to derisk the company's business model further as the founders continued to grow and develop the application and company. -->

**Description**: Rebuildee stands at the forefront of humanitarian innovation as a pioneering crowdfunding platform, dedicated to accelerating the recovery of those devastated by natural disasters.
