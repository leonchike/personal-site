**Company:** Rebuildee is a crowdfunding platform designed to help those affected by natural disasters recover through the aid of private and non-profit donors.

I joined Rebuildee as a product designer in December 2021 to design the initial version of the app to aid the founders in fundraising. After the initial seed raise, I joined the company as the head of engineering. I led a team of six to build the platform's MVP/Beta and launch versions. I worked with the company's CTO to ship personalized features, build product roadmaps, and manage the engineering team in the capacity of a project manager.

I set a strategy for future growth. I designed a framework to derisk the company's business model further as the founders continue to grow and develop the application and company.
