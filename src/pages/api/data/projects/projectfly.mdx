A few years ago, I had the pleasure of joining a unique UK-based team. I was a product manager and designer responsible for shipping a flight-simulation log and fleet management application.
The app tracks the user's flight in real-time and helps them plan routes, payloads, and fuel requirements taking real-time global weather and NOTAM restrictions into consideration.

The goal was to create a full-featured application with pilot immersion as an absolute goal. To achieve this goal, we carefully selected colors, introduced animations that feel natural, and used imagery to convey meaning via context and set a mood for each significant app interaction.
