One of the first connections I made with my wife was through our love for food. It serves as a way to connect, experiment with flavors, and find joy.

When we begin, we typically find an interesting recipe. They could be sourced from the web, one of our numerous cookbooks, or through friends, family, or connections made through others. As we cook and become more proficient over time, we deviate from the set recipes to add our own flair. This leads to our main problem... tracking hundreds of recipes we have improved upon. To address this problem, I created a custom recipe site to help us add, customize and reference recipes on any device. This project was born out of necessity but has served us well for years.
