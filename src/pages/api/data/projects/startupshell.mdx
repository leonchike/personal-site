The Startup Shell is a student-formed, University and privately backed organization that gives entrepreneurs a space to build their ideas. I joined the organization immediately after its funding, benefiting from the technology provided and connections to advisors and investors.

After graduating, I have remained a mentor for those building technology companies. When available, I also volunteer my time to participate in speaking engagements.
