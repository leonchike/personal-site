This website is a personal project that I started in 2022. It is a cms app built with Next.js, TypeScript and Next.js edge-functions. It is hosted on Vercel and uses Cloudinary for image hosting.

The website is fully responsive, prioritizes speed and is built with accessibility in mind. It is also fully open source and is available on GitHub.

<h3>My motivation</h3>

I have to admit that I love creating websites. At work, for family,
friends, and myself... when I can find the time.

I created this website to create a space to share aspects of my life, my work, and my interests. It serves as a place to reflect on my past experiences and grounds my thinking about the future. I have had the good fortune to work in some fantastic teams with highly talented individuals and travel to places I wish to visit again.

I aimed to keep this space simple and clean to focus on the content and express what means the most to me. I hope you enjoy it.
