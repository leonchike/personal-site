I have to admit that I love creating websites. At work, for family, friends, and myself... when I can find the time.

I created this website to create a space to share aspects of my life, my work, and my interests. It serves as a place to reflect on my past experiences and grounds my thinking about the future. I have had the good fortune to work in some fantastic teams with highly talented individuals and travel to places I wish to visit again.

I aimed to keep this space simple and clean to focus on the content and express what means the most to me. I hope you enjoy it.
