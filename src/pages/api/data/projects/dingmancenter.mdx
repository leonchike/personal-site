The Dingman center is a University of Maryland organization that promotes entrepreneurship and innovation. They provide resources to students and alums to help them build their startups. These resources include a co-working space, a makerspace, pitch competitions, and mentorship,

I serve as a mentor and advisor to those building their businesses. Mainly I focus my efforts on helping students and alums develop and test their initial ideas. I also help them build their business models and pitch decks and help them find and hire the right team members. Each year, when available, I serve as a judge for their pitch competitions.
