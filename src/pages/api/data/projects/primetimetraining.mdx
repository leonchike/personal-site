### PrimeTime Training: Revolutionizing Soccer Training Management

</br>

### The Challenge

PrimeTime Training, founded by a dear friend, is an exemplary advanced soccer training center (or football for most!). Previously, the complexities of managing customers, selling packages, tracking memberships, and billing were done manually, piecing together various tools. But as the brand set its eyes on geographic expansion within the United States, the necessity for an integrated digital solution became paramount.

### My Contribution: An All-In-One Digital Solution

Together, we embarked on a mission to centralize the operational intricacies into one robust application tailored to PrimeTime's unique needs.

- **Admin Dashboard:** This powerful tool is the backbone of the business. It allows seamless management of all customers and bookings while providing the flexibility to customize product offerings as and when needed.

- **Public Interface:** Beyond administrative functionalities, the application becomes a digital storefront. It vividly showcases PrimeTime's offerings, spanning different locations and packages. Potential clients can:
  - Explore the vast availability of sessions.
  - Register and create their accounts.
  - Seamlessly pay for the services they wish to avail.
