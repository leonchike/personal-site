A close friend founded and operates an advanced soccer (football for most :D) training center. In the past, a large portion of his operations was managed manually using available tools to onboard customers, sell packages, and track and bill memberships.

I joined his team to help create a single application for his business's needs. This became more critical as he began his geographic expansion in the United States.

On the admin side of the app, he can manage all customers and bookings and customize his product offerings. The app's public views allow him to showcase offerings, locations, and packages. Customers can browse the general availability, create accounts and pay for services.
