I led a variety of teams at Deloitte each specializing in various parts of its emerging technology buisness.

**Software Development** - Led a data analytics team at Deloitte to build client-facing software that analyzed data from a variety of sources to provide insights into the performance of each client project. The software was built using a variety of technologies including Python, SQL, and Tableau. The team was responsible for the design, development, and testing of the software. The software was used by clients to improve their management decision making, and was used by Deloitte to improve its internal processes.

**Project Management** - Utilized python on Microsoft databases to record, maintain and report project data to team leads to keep Deloitte internal and client facing projects on track. Reporting was used by Deloitte to build financial forcasts and analyze the project burn rate.

**Process Robotics (RPA)** - Developed RPA tool that compiled and analyzed data for the financial valuation of pension plans. The tool significantly reduced process cycle time, and increased accuracy. Used tool to lead team through valuation of a pension plan with over 165,000 participants.
