As the head of engineering at Rebuildee, I led a team to build the MVP/Beta and launch version of the platform. I worked directly with the company's CTO to ship personalized features, build product roadmaps, and manage the engineering team.

Prior to my departure, I set a strategy for future growth and designed a framework to futher test the core business model.
