## API Documentation

The website integrates with a RESTful API to fetch and manage data. Detailed API documentation can be found in the [API Docs](docs/api.md) file.

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure the reliability and stability of the website. To run the tests, use the following command:

```
npm run test
```

The tests cover various aspects of the application, including components, pages, and API endpoints.

## Deployment

The website is deployed using Vercel, which provides seamless integration with Next.js applications. The deployment process is automated through a CI/CD pipeline triggered by pushing changes to the main branch.

To deploy the website manually, run the following command:

```
npm run deploy
```

## Optimization

Several optimization techniques have been applied to enhance the performance of the website:

- Code splitting and lazy loading to reduce initial bundle size
- Image optimization using Next.js built-in image component
- Caching of frequently accessed data using SWR library
- Minimizing the use of client-side JavaScript for faster page loads

## Future Enhancements

Some planned enhancements for the website include:

- Implementing a blog section to share technical articles and insights
- Adding a contact form for visitors to get in touch
- Integrating with a CMS for easier content management
- Enhancing the project details page with more interactive elements
